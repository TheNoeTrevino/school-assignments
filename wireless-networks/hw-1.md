# Question 1

What is wireless communication, and how does it differ from wired
communication in terms of technology and applications?

# Question 2
What challenges do wireless networks face in ensuring reliable communication
in environments with high user density, such as stadiums or urban areas?

# Question 3
How does a sinusoidal waveform contribute to the modulation of signals in
wireless communication protocols?

# Question 4
Define Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) and
Phase Shift Keying. Give example of each.

5. What is multiplexing in communication systems? Explain the purpose and
importance of multiplexing in maximizing the utilization of communication
channels.

6. Explain the significance of antennas in wireless communication systems. How
do different antenna design impact signal propagation and coverage?

7. A company is claiming that they have a modulation and FEC technique that will
allow nearly error free data transmission at a rate of 80 Mbps
over a 20 MHz channel that has an SNR of 5 dB with white, Gaussian noise.
Give a brief explanation of why this is, or is not, credible. Show your
calculations.

8. A wireless communication system operates over a noiseless channel with a
bandwidth of 20 MHz and achieves a channel capacity of 100 Mbps. Determine
how many signal levels are required to achieve this channel capacity.
