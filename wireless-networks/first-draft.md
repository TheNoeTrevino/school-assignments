# First Draft: Private 5G Networks

## Abstract

5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. It uses shorted milimeter
wave frequncies on wider spectrum bands to deliver faster speeds and lower
latency. Public 5G networks suffer from the pursit of high covered to increase
their revenue. This can result in poor coverage indoors, and less than optiimal
security. This is where private wireless 5g networks come into play.
