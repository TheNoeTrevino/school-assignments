# First Draft: Private 5G Networks

## Abstract

5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. It uses shorted millimeter
wave frequencies on wider spectrum bands to deliver faster speeds and lower
latency. Public 5G networks suffer from the pursuit of high covered to increase
their revenue. This can result in poor coverage indoors, and less than optimal
security. This is where private wireless 5g networks come into play. Private 5g
networks can have optimized coverage and security. This paper will discuss the
benefits and the challenges of this technology.  

## Introduction

A private 5G network is a network dedicated to private use by an organization.
This offers the same benefits as a public 5G network, but with more control over
the users and the security of those users. The control over the security,
policies, services and the transmission of the data can be of large appeal to
companies who are particularly concerned with privacy and security of their
data.

Using graph theory, we can model the network as a graph. The nodes are the
potential locations of the base stations, and the edges are the ways the signal
can be spread strategically. We can use this modeling strategies to properly
depict the movement of the data in the network. Allowing the potential
stakeholders using these networks to fully understand how their data is being
transferred in the network. 

## Methods

Telecommunication expert Ericsson (insert source here) defined 5 key
requirements for private 5G networks: availability, reliability, security,
inter-networking, and quality of service. 

## Use Cases

A study by Ericsson showed that 5G networks can be used in a variety of market
types.

We can see 10 strong use case clusters for private 5G networks here.
